# px-spawner

*px-spawner* is a simple JavaScript game all about filling your window with colorful squares. each time you press a key, a new square appears on the page in a random location, and with each press, the square cycles through the colors of a randomly chosen color palette from [lospec.com]. 

each square is 1/n the width and 1/n the height of the window and appears in a random location in the nxn grid. once the window fills, the grid clears and is squared in size. 

enjoy this mind-numbing task of filling your screen with colors!
